Allows to see autocompletion for static entity metamodels in JSF EL.

This plugin makes easier to fill in the 'field', 'sortBy' and 'filterBy' attributes in column components from frameworks like PrimeFaces.
    
Installing this plugin you will get autocompletion in the earlier mentioned attributes for the pre-generated static metamodel for entities.

To use it you have to generate the static metamodel classes annotated with 'javax.persistence.metamodel.StaticMetamodel' annotation.
